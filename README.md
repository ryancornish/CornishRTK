# CornishRTK
CornishRTK (Cornish Real-Time Kernel) is a compact, single-core, preemptive scheduler and synchronization kernel written in modern C++. It provides just enough kernel primitives to build or host higher-level threading systems - including the ability to run std::thread, std::mutex, and related C++ standard library features via the GCC gthreads API.
